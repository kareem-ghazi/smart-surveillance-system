# Smart Surveillance System

This project is a smart surveillance system that could be used to recognize registered people on the system, detect how many people are there, or to monitor for suspicious or unknown people in a certain area.

The system has been built in C++ using [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) along with a header-only library for the GUI called [cvui](https://github.com/Dovyski/cvui). It utilizes the [Violaâ€“Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola%E2%80%93Jones_object_detection_framework) algorithm and runs the image processing on the CPU (a GPU port for this project exists as well using NVIDIA CUDA).
## Features

Some of the features currently implemented are: 

- Detecting faces.
- Recognizing registered faces.
- Information panel for keeping track of currently detected people in the frame.
- Options for enabling/disabling the webcam and the FPS counter.
- Adding people to the system.
- Removing people from the system.
